Hello!

It’s the Nextstrain team.  We’re writing to let you know about improvements
we’ve made to how you manage your data in Nextstrain Groups.  We’ve put
together a documentation page with information about the changes, including the
actions requested of you:

** Please review the details there and reply to this email with the information

You’re receiving this email because you’re a contact for one or more Nextstrain

Thank you for being an early adopter of Nextstrain Groups!  We’re excited to
keep improving the functionality of Groups.  If you have any feedback, please
