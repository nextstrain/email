Hello!

<p>
It’s the Nextstrain team.
We’re writing to let you know about improvements we’ve made to how you manage your data in Nextstrain Groups.
We’ve put together <a href="https://docs.nextstrain.org/page/guides/share/groups/migrate-from-s3.html">a documentation page</a> with information about the changes, including the actions requested of you.
<strong>Please review the details there and reply to this email with the information requested.</strong>

<p>
You’re receiving this email because you’re a contact for one or more Nextstrain Groups:

<ul>
[%- FOREACH group IN groups %]
  <li><a href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/[% group | uri %]">nextstrain.org/groups/[% group | html %]</a></li>
[%- END %]
</ul>

Thank you for being an early adopter of Nextstrain Groups!
We’re excited to keep improving the functionality of Groups.
