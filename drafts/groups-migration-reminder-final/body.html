Hello!

<p>
It’s the Nextstrain team.
We previously emailed you on 10 January 2023 and 7 November 2022 about improvements we’ve made to how Nextstrain Groups are managed.
This is a second (and final) reminder since we haven’t heard back from you yet and would like your co-operation when upgrading your Groups.

<p>
If we don’t hear back from you by the <strong>end of February 2023</strong> (this month), we will proceed with upgrading your Groups <strong>without your involvement</strong>.
Upgrading without your involvement will <strong>disrupt your ability to upload new datasets and manage existing datasets</strong> until you complete your own part of the upgrade.

<p>
We’ve put together <a href="https://docs.nextstrain.org/page/guides/share/groups/migrate-from-s3.html">a documentation page</a> with information about the changes, including the actions required of you.
<strong>Please review the details there and reply to this email with the information required before the end of February 2023.</strong>

<p>
You’re receiving this email because you’re an owner or editor of one or more Nextstrain Groups:

<ul>
[%- FOREACH group IN groups %]
  <li><a href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/[% group | uri %]">nextstrain.org/groups/[% group | html %]</a></li>
[%- END %]
</ul>

<p>
Thank you for being an early adopter of Nextstrain Groups!
We’re excited to keep improving the functionality of Groups.
If you have any feedback, please don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:hello@nextstrain.org">email us</a> or post to <a href="https://discussions.nextstrain.org">discussions.nextstrain.org</a>.
