Hello,

This is a reminder that your [% IF groups.size > 1 %]Nextstrain Groups are[% ELSE %]Nextstrain Group is[% END %] set to be upgraded
after the end of the month (as early as 1 March 2023).  You’re receiving
this email because you’re an owner or editor of the Nextstrain Group[% IF groups.size > 1 %]s[% END %]:

[%- FOREACH group IN groups %]
    - https://nextstrain.org/groups/[% group | uri %]
[%- END %]

We previously emailed¹ you on 10 January 2023 and 7 November 2022 about
improvements we’ve made to how Nextstrain Groups are managed.  This is a
second and final reminder since we haven’t heard back from you yet and
would still like your co-operation when upgrading your Group[% IF groups.size > 1 %]s[% END %].

The upgrade may **temporarily disrupt your ability to upload new
datasets and manage existing datasets** until you complete your own part
of the upgrade.  We’ve put together a documentation page with
information about the changes, including the actions required of you:

    https://docs.nextstrain.org/page/guides/share/groups/migrate-from-s3.html

Thank you for being an early adopter of Nextstrain Groups!  We’re
excited to keep improving the functionality of Groups.  If you have any
feedback, please don’t hesitate to email us <hello@nextstrain.org> or
post to <https://discussions.nextstrain.org>.
