Hello,

<p>
This is a reminder that your [% IF groups.size > 1 %]Nextstrain Groups are[% ELSE %]Nextstrain Group is[% END %] set to be upgraded after the end of the month (as early as 1 March 2023).
You’re receiving this email because you’re an owner or editor of the Nextstrain Group[% IF groups.size > 1 %]s[% END %]:

<ul>
[%- FOREACH group IN groups %]
  <li><a href="https://nextstrain.org/groups/[% group | uri %]">nextstrain.org/groups/[% group | html %]</a></li>
[%- END %]
</ul>

<p>
We <a href="https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/guides/share/groups/migrate-from-s3.html#notification">previously emailed</a> you on 10 January 2023 and 7 November 2022 about improvements we’ve made to how Nextstrain Groups are managed.
This is a second and final reminder since we haven’t heard back from you yet and would still like your co-operation when upgrading your Group[% IF groups.size > 1 %]s[% END %].

<p>
The upgrade may <strong>temporarily disrupt your ability to upload new datasets and manage existing datasets</strong> until you complete your own part of the upgrade.
We’ve put together <a href="https://docs.nextstrain.org/page/guides/share/groups/migrate-from-s3.html">a documentation page</a> with information about the changes, including the actions required of you.

<p>
Thank you for being an early adopter of Nextstrain Groups!
We’re excited to keep improving the functionality of Groups.
If you have any feedback, please don’t hesitate to <a href="mailto:hello@nextstrain.org">email us</a> or post to <a href="https://discussions.nextstrain.org">discussions.nextstrain.org</a>.
