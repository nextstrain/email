# Groups migration reminder

Re: <https://docs.nextstrain.org/page/guides/share/groups/migrate-from-s3.html>

Followup to the [initial email](../../sent/2022-11-07-groups-migration/).

Sent to owners of still-unmigrated groups with their own (now legacy) S3 buckets.

One email per group (or set of related groups, e.g. `example` and
`example-private`), sent `To:` the owners ([identified
previously](https://github.com/nextstrain/groups-migration/tree/main/owner-identification)).

This email calls the migration an "upgrade" instead, which is the friendlier
term I probably should have used in user-facing copy all along.
