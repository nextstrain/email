Hello!

It’s the Nextstrain team.  We previously emailed you on 7 November 2022 about
improvements we’ve made to how Nextstrain Groups are managed.  This is a
reminder since we haven’t heard back from you yet and would like your
co-operation when upgrading your Groups.

If we don’t hear back from you by the **end of February 2023**, we will proceed
with upgrading your Groups **without your involvement**.  Upgrading without
your involvement will **disrupt your ability to upload new datasets and manage
existing datasets** until you complete your own part of the upgrade.

We’ve put together a documentation page with information about the changes,
including the actions required of you:

    https://docs.nextstrain.org/page/guides/share/groups/migrate-from-s3.html

** Please review the details there and reply to this email with the information
required before the end of February 2023. **

You’re receiving this email because you’re an owner of one or more Nextstrain
Groups:

[%- FOREACH group IN groups %]
    - https://nextstrain.org/groups/[% group | uri %]
[%- END %]

Thank you for being an early adopter of Nextstrain Groups!  We’re excited to
keep improving the functionality of Groups.  If you have any feedback, please
don’t hesitate to email us <hello@nextstrain.org> or post to
<https://discussions.nextstrain.org>.
